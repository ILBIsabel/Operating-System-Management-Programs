# Operating-System-Management-Programs
### Overview
This project showcases a series of hands-on implementations that explore core concepts of operating systems. Through multiple C-based simulations and algorithms, I gained practical experience with CPU scheduling, memory management, synchronization, and resource allocation.

All programs were written in C and demonstrate key operating system mechanisms using fundamental algorithms and techniques.

# Topics Covered
Developed and implemented a series of comprehensive projects demonstrating various aspects of operating system management, including:

1. ### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Implemented and analyzed classic scheduling methods to understand how the OS manages process execution:

**First Come First Serve (FCFS)**

**Shortest Job First (SJF)**

2. ### Race Condition Management
Explored thread behavior and concurrency issues using POSIX threads:

**Created multi-threaded programs to simulate race conditions**

**Applied thread synchronization to resolve conflicts**

3. ### Banker's Algorithm
Developed a resource allocation simulation using the Banker's Algorithm:

**Ensured deadlock avoidance and system safety**

**Modeled dynamic resource requests and availability**

4. ### Memory Management Techniques
Implemented different memory allocation strategies to evaluate efficiency:

**First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, Next Fit**

5. ### Page Replacement Algorithms
Simulated memory paging to optimize memory usage and study cache behavior:

**First-In First-Out (FIFO)**

**Least Recently Used (LRU)**

6. ### Disk Scheduling Algorithms
Designed algorithms to manage disk I/O requests and measure performance:

**First Come First Serve (FCFS)**

**Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
