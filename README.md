# Operating-System-Management-Programs
Developed and implemented a series of comprehensive projects demonstrating various aspects of operating system management, including:

CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Designed and implemented First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms.

Race Condition Management: Created multi-threaded programs using POSIX threads to demonstrate race conditions and implemented thread synchronization.

Banker's Algorithm: Developed a simulation for the Banker's Algorithm to manage resource allocation and ensure system safety.

Memory Management Techniques: Implemented and compared First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit memory allocation strategies.

Page Replacement Algorithms: Designed and tested FIFO and Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithms to optimize memory usage.

Disk Scheduling Algorithms: Implemented and analyzed the performance of FCFS and Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) disk scheduling algorithms.

Key Skills: C programming, Operating System concepts, Multithreading, Memory Management, Resource Allocation, Synchronization, Algorithm Design and Analysis.
